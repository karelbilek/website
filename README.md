My current webpage.

It gets hosted on fly.io for free (!).

It is now running at https://karelbilek.com

I tried to get both Gemini and HTTP working at the same time, while still being hosted on fly; it seems to be working!

It is using https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto and https://github.com/n0x1m/gmifs code, but very heavily modified. I will probably simplify it further if I ever have time (not).
