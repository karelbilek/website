I am also on Facebook, not very hard to find, and on LinkedIn (but just for work stuff). Currently I am on Twitter, but considering deleting it, I guess after I get more comfortable here.

## Past

In the past, I was more "cypherpunk" than now. I got involved in scraping/archiving Pirate Bay, I got involved in bitcoin development and tooling around that (at one point in 2012, I owned about 30000 BTC, lol).

I guess what kind of stopped me was seeing what happened to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general; and that made me reconsider if the starting point made any sense. I kind of changed my life views and priorities since then, basically after reading Catechism of Catholic Church and writings of St. Augustine. I might share more here when I have time/mood.
