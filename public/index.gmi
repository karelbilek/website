## Past

In the past, I was more "cypherpunk" than now. I got involved in scraping/archiving Pirate Bay, I got involved in bitcoin development and tooling around that (at one point in 2012, I owned about 30000 BTC, lol). I am not involved in that anymore. Some previous articles from that time:

=> btcinputs/ 2017-08-17 Statistics of bitcoin input script lengths
